## OpenCopilot flows definition (FD)

A OpenCopilot flows definition is a single json file that describe different flows in your APIs, for example, if your product contain "add to cart" functionality, then you can
map this functionality to a flow, which represent set of APIs calls.


**This is an example on OpenCopilot flows definition file:**

It's easy! you can use the [flows editor](https://editor.opencopilot.so/) to write your flows, their description and the APIs calls of each flow.

If you do not like writing json blocks, you can use our flow UI editor to visually build flows, for example, we were able to create search and create pet flow with few click

## Flows Best Practices

Flows are still in beta, and there are some areas where they currently lack functionality. To make the most of flows in OpenCopilot, ensure that your flow definition files always align with your Swagger file in terms of `open_api_operation_id`. Additionally, try to minimize the response data from each step (only pass the important fields between steps, not the entire API response).
